# eden-chess-engine

https://www.chessprogramming.org/Eden

In 1989 I was studying Artificial Intelligence & Computer Science at Edinburgh university.

In one of the classes we had the assigment to write an article/essay about an AI related topic.

I had become fascinated by computer chess, and had heard about an unusual (as in: not the standard minimax, alpha-beta, etc.) approach called "Paradise", by D. Wilkins. I decided to write an essay based on it.

Years later (around 2004) I had finally decided to write my own chess engine. Since my objective was purely educational, I decided that I'd use the language with which I was the most familiar at the time, Java.

Eden is what came out of it.

The name was meant to be an hommage to the "Paradise" approach, but used the traditional alpha-beta approach.

I managed to lose all my source code at one point (GitHub didn't exist yet). Eventually I decompiled it and cleaned it up a little bit.

Hence this repository.
